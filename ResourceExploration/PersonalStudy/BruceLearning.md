## Bruce's Personal Study Future

I was looking at the [Jupyter{Book} Archive](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery/) and realized there are a number of (possibly) well written books relative to geographic data that I should spemnd time with relative to this project. To limit my rabbit hole time I am capturing them here for the future.

### [Good Research Code](https://goodresearch.dev/)

"This handbook is for grad students, postdocs and PIs who do a lot of programming as part of their research. It will teach you, in a practical manner, how to organize your code so that it is easy to understand and works reliably."

### [Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html)

"This book provides the tools, the methods, and the theory to meet the challenges of contemporary data science applied to geographic problems and data. Social media, new forms of data, and new computational techniques are revolutionizing social science. In the new world of pervasive, large, frequent, and rapid data, we have new opportunities to understand and analyze the role of geography in everyday life. This book provides the first comprehensive curriculum in geographic data science."

### [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html)

"Computing has become an indispensable tool for nearly all Earth and Environmental Scientists, but it doesnâ€™t often appear in our curriculums. This book focuses on data analysis, a subset of computing in which the data already exist, e.g.from observations or from the output of a simulation, but have to be transformed into understanding. There are many different ways to gain understanding, but most workflows often boil down to:

    read data files

    perform some analysis operations, from very simple (e.g. take the mean) to very complex (e.g. train a deep neural network)

    visualize the output in a plot
