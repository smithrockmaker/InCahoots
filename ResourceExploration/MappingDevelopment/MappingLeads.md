## Other Tree/Orchard Mapping Leads

[Collaborative Orchard Mapping App (regisTree)](https://montezumaorchard.org/registree/)

Seems effective for locating orchards and some trees but doesn't match my use case model.

[OpenTreeMap](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/53/#)

This is the descriptor on Citizen Science. It feels like it's a clone of the OpenStreetMap project applied to tree mapping. I like the concept but I'm not ready to try and implement and instance of the this server based concept. Looking for something I can get my arms around more successfully. [Github for OpenTreeMap (otm)](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/opentreemap.github.com) is here along with suggestions for setting up a local server - ouch

[Plotting with Folium](https://dev.to/manifoldmindaway/plotting-the-trees-of-nyc-with-folium-4ffo)
Seems like an interesting project though it seems a little effortful.

[Python Libraries for GIS/Mapping](https://gisgeography.com/python-libraries-gis-mapping/)

As it says.
