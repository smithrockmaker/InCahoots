## Other Heirloom Apple Projects and Resources

[Temperate Orchard Conservancy](/https://www.temperateorchardconservancy.org/)

These local folks have done some 'cloning' (propagation) from various trees.

[Montezuma Orchard Restoration Project (MORP)](https://montezumaorchard.org/)

Cortez Colorado restoration project. A connection here to the Open Orchard Mapping app which is doing some good work but doesn't quite match my vision of the use case. Link in MappingDevelopment.

[Lost Apple Project](https://www.facebook.com/lostappleproject/)

Based in Whitman County. Primary contact through Facebook (ugh) but it will work.
